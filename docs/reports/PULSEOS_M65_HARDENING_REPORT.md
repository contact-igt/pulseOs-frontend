# PULSEOS BETA V1 — M6.5 PRE-M7 HARDENING REPORT

Branch `claude/wonderful-carson-o7jbjk` (not merged, not deployed, no live provider contacted). Baseline `984f1ed`.

## STATUS

**M6.5 complete.** Every item in scope is implemented, tested and verified on a database rebuilt from scratch. The five
focused reviews found 14 issues; each Critical/Important one was verified in the code before fixing and all are fixed.
Final gate: see TEST RESULTS.

## APPOINTMENT PAST-TIME VALIDATION

- `POST /appointments` refuses a time in the past with **422 `appointment_time_in_past`** — never a 500, nothing saved.
- The rule is judged on the **instant**; an offset-less time (`2026-10-02T09:00`) is read as **hospital wall time**, never
  the server's or browser's zone (`parseInstant`). A wall time inside a DST gap is refused rather than moved an hour.
- Direct API calls cannot bypass it (tested through the real route, and by an E2E `fetch`).
- UI: the New Appointment picker defaults to tomorrow-on-the-hour **in the hospital's zone** (it used UTC), is bounded at
  "now", and explains a past pick inline — "Choose a future appointment time." — disabling Book. Everything typed is kept
  when the server refuses.
- Tests: future / past / earlier today / later today / around hospital midnight while UTC is on the previous day /
  malformed; unit tests for the picker under a non-IST zone and a fake clock.

## RESOURCE DOUBLE-BOOKING

**Rule.** Appointments have a start time but **no duration** in the current product, so a collision is the **same
doctor/resource at the same start minute** (seconds never make a free slot) among *live* visits: cancelled and no-show
free the slot; booked, confirmed, checked-in, waiting, with-doctor and **completed** hold it. No duration or 30-minute
grid was invented. Branch is deliberately not part of the key: a doctor cannot be at two places at once.

**Concurrency.** Create and reschedule take a per-resource **advisory transaction lock** (`pg_advisory_xact_lock`, keyed on
tenant + resource) and check inside it, so racing requests serialise and exactly one wins. Verified: six parallel bookings
→ one 201 and five 409; and with the lock removed all six succeeded (the test is not vacuous). A unique index was
deliberately **not** used: historical rows may share a minute, and a migration must not fail on real data. Reschedule —
including re-activating a cancelled / no-show visit — runs the same check, excluding itself.

**UX.** Error `resource_unavailable` (409) with copy *"This doctor already has another appointment at this time. Choose a
different time or doctor."* — it never names the other patient. A new advisory `GET /appointments/slot-check` (yes/no
only, same permission as viewing appointments) warns as soon as doctor and time are picked; changing the doctor clears the
warning immediately. Tenant isolation: another hospital's doctor is a 404, and its bookings never block this one.

## TREATMENT COMPLETION DATE

**Schema.** Migration **0026**: `treatment_opportunities.completed_at timestamptz`, a partial index `(tenant_id,
completed_at)`, and a CHECK `completed_at IS NULL OR status = 'COMPLETED'`. Additive; applies on an empty database and on
seeded data; drizzle drift check clean.

**Transition.** `updateTreatmentStatus` stamps `completed_at` with the server clock in the same transaction (and the same
instant as the payment event). `COMPLETED` is a final state (no transition leaves it), so it is stamped exactly once;
completing again is a 409 with no second timeline line, payment or follow-up; racing completions yield one stamp. Nothing
else writes the column. The status endpoint also can no longer rewrite "Scheduled for" while completing (only on the way to
SCHEDULED) and validates its body.

**Historical behaviour.** Backfill uses **only** the Timeline line the transition itself wrote (`Treatment "…" —
completed`). A completed row with no such line keeps `completed_at = NULL` — **never inferred from a payment**. Such rows
read **"Date not recorded"**, are excluded from date-specific completed counts, and are surfaced as *"N completed, date not
recorded"*. On the seeded database all 20 existing completed rows were backfilled from their Timeline.

## OPERATIONS REPORT

- **Completed procedures:** counted by `completed_at` in hospital-local days. Three distinct facts, tested separately:
  **Scheduled for** (`planned_date`, the calendar and "Procedures planned"), **Completed on** (`completed_at`),
  **Payment date** (`revenue_events.occurred_at`). A procedure scheduled D1, completed D2 and paid D3 appears on exactly D1,
  D2 and D3 for the matching question — and a completion at 00:20 IST counts on the IST day although UTC is the day before.
- **Revenue date:** unchanged; revenue analytics still use the payment event's own date.
- **Excel export:** new **Procedures** workbook with *Scheduled for*, *Completed on*, *Payment date* as separate columns
  ("Date not recorded" where missing, never substituted) and an *In this report* column saying which KPI each row belongs to,
  so it reconciles with the screen; the summary workbook states the undated count.

## SYSTEM STAGES VS OUTCOMES

Settings → Workflow Outcomes now shows all nine journey stages in lifecycle order as **locked, PulseOS-owned** stages
("System stage · fixed", plain-language how a journey gets there). Only **Contacted** and **Lost** take outcomes; the other
seven say "Set automatically" and offer no controls. Under those two, a hospital can add, rename, **reorder (drag handle,
keyboard, or arrows)** and archive outcomes; archived ones stay readable on history. Server rules: stage values are limited
to the two; an outcome **already recorded on journeys keeps its stage** (409 `outcome_in_use`) — archive and add a new one;
a reorder that mixes stages is refused. The stage list is guarded against drifting from the database enum. No workflow
engine was built.

## LOGIN RATE LIMIT

**Implemented.** In-memory, SHA-256-keyed throttle: **5 attempts per account+address** and **50 per address** per 15
minutes (env-tunable) → **429** with `Retry-After` and one generic message, answered *before* the password is checked and
identically for unknown and known accounts (unknown accounts now cost one decoy verification so timing does not reveal
them). An attempt is **reserved when admitted**, so a parallel burst of 25 guesses admits exactly 5; a successful sign-in
clears that pair and returns its reservation; IPv6 clients key on their /64. Developer Login (no password) is unaffected.
**Reason / limits:** it uses the existing stack (no new dependency); state is per process — behind several API instances each
enforces its own limit (a shared store is the upgrade path). `TRUST_PROXY=<hops>` makes `request.ip` the client behind a
reverse proxy; without it all clients share the proxy's address.

## LEGACY DATA HANDLING

- Demo data repaired, nothing fabricated: every seeded SCHEDULED procedure now has a planned date, doctor and branch (7/7),
  every COMPLETED one has its fixture completion time (18/18); a regression test guards both.
- Real legacy rows stay readable: *Doctor not recorded* / *Date not recorded* (Treatments table, pipeline, journey page).
- The seed builds its two service-made visits through free slots, and backdates the booking time so seeding at any hour works.

## TIMEZONE REGRESSION TESTING

Retained and extended: Asia/Kolkata and UTC, UTC date ≠ hospital date, DST gap, appointment creation (offset-less input,
hospital midnight), follow-up display, report day buckets, completion-date reporting; the booking E2E now runs under a **Los
Angeles browser** and asserts the stored hospital time.

## DEVELOPER LOGIN TEST FIX

The stale assertion (`desktop height < 44`) contradicted the touch-target direction. It now requires **≥ 44px on touch
widths, ≥ 32px on desktop with no upper bound**, every control on screen, no page overflow. Ran 5× consecutively: green.
The control was not shrunk.

## TENANT / RBAC / SECURITY

- Tenant always from the session; foreign doctor/resource/outcome ids are refused (404/400); workbook and report show none
  of another hospital's rows; exports remain admin-only (`EXPORT_REPORTS`) and log kind/rows/user, never patient data.
- **Export audit note:** no AuditEvent store exists, so a full audit-log module is **deferred** (not built here); the export
  endpoint was re-inspected — permission, tenant scope, no cross-tenant ids, no PHI in logs — and the filename is slugged.
- Review-driven hardening: atomic throttle, proxy-hop trust (never "trust every X-Forwarded-For"), IPv6 /64.

## RESPONSIVE / UX

390px verified for Workflow Outcomes (arrows are 44×44, grip hidden, no overflow), the booking drawer and the report; copy is
plain ("This doctor already has another appointment…", "Choose a future appointment time.", "Scheduled for / Completed on").

PLACEHOLDER_RESULTS

## FILES / MIGRATIONS CHANGED

- **Migration:** `0026_m65_treatment_completed_at.sql` (+ snapshot, journal). No other schema change.
- **API:** appointment service/routes (booking, slot-check), `hospital-time.ts` (`parseInstant`), treatment service/routes,
  journey service, report service/export/routes, CRM outcome service/routes, auth routes/service, `login-throttle.ts`,
  `trust-proxy.ts`, `app.ts`, seed (shared, gynecology, appointment-demo).
- **Web/UI:** `NewAppointmentDrawer`, `format.ts`, Treatments/pipeline/journey/surgery date labels, `treatmentDates.ts`,
  `OutcomesSection`, `stageModel.ts`, `SortableList.tsx`, `OutcomeEditorSheet`, report view, CRM field arrow targets.
- **Types:** `JOURNEY_STAGES`, `TreatmentRow.completedAt`, report types (`proceduresCompletedUndated`, `procedures` export).
- **Tests:** 7 new API/UI test files, extended suites, a new Playwright spec, corrected dev-login spec.

## REMAINING RISKS

1. **No appointment duration:** a 15-minute-apart overlap (10:00 vs 10:10) is not detected; only the same minute is. Needs a
   product decision on visit length before M7 reminder windows depend on it.
2. **Throttle state is per process** (multi-instance deployments need a shared store) and in-memory (resets on restart).
3. **Per-address cap (50) behind one hospital NAT** can lock the site if 50 *failed* attempts accumulate in 15 minutes;
   tunable via env.
4. **Historical completed treatments without a Timeline line stay undated** — surfaced, not guessed; a one-off data
   clean-up decision for real customers.
5. **No AuditEvent store** — exports are logged only in the server log.
6. **Export builds in memory** before the 50,000-row check (admin-only, bounded by a 366-day period).
7. **Reschedule still returns `scheduled_in_past`** while create returns `appointment_time_in_past` (UI maps both).
8. **Node 22 in this cloud vs Node 24 locked**, and the Playwright browser pin differs from the image (worked around).
9. **Live integrations remain fixtures** (WhatsApp/Meta/Google/Runo) — M7 needs sandbox credentials to prove delivery.
10. **`pg_advisory_xact_lock` serialises per resource**: fine at hospital scale; very hot resources would queue.

## M7 READINESS

**READY.** The reasons: booking can no longer create a past or double-booked visit (server-enforced, concurrency-safe,
tenant-scoped), so reminder schedules derived from appointments rest on valid times; treatment completion and "scheduled
for" are separate, stamped facts, so surgery follow-ups and post-op reminders can key on the right date; hospital-time
handling is consistent from picker to storage to report; and the full gate passed on a rebuilt database.

**Recommend M7 — Notification + Reminder Engine**, in fixture mode first (the M6 domain events are the subscription point),
with a product decision on appointment duration (risk 1) taken before reminder windows are tuned.

*M7 was not started.*
