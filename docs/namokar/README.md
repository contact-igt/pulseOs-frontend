# Namokar Eye & Oculoplasty Centre — PulseOS V1 Pilot

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pilot** | **ENABLED** — a dedicated tenant in the same PulseOS app (no fork). Sign-in page: `/login/namokar`. Each PulseOS hospital workspace has a dedicated branded login URL; Namokar uses the standard system ([architecture](../tenant-branded-login.md)). |
| **Revenue** | **DISABLED** for this hospital (capability `REVENUE_TRACKING` is off by the hospital's own setting; nothing is deleted for other hospitals) |
| **Runo (calls)** | Configured as a **FIXTURE** (nothing real is contacted). Manual call logging works today. Live Runo needs the hospital's Runo credentials in Integrations. |
| **WhatsApp notifications** | **FIXTURE** (confirmations are recorded, not sent). Live sending needs the hospital's WhatsApp Business details in Integrations. WhatsApp Inbox and Conversation Intelligence are **off**. |
| **CCS IVR** | **Not configured** (needs the provider's documentation). |
| **Meta / Google lead ingestion** | **Not configured live.** Leads from ads are entered by hand (source *Google*, *Instagram*, *Facebook*…) until a connector is set up. |
| **Website "I am interested" form** | Protected endpoint ready; needs the website to post to it — see [NAMOKAR_WEBSITE_INTAKE.md](NAMOKAR_WEBSITE_INTAKE.md). |

## The pilot shape

One clinic (Ashok Vihar, New Delhi), one doctor (Dr. Poonam Jain), and **three people who share the phones**: the Receptionist and two Patient Coordinators. Because there is exactly one branch and one doctor, PulseOS **does not ask** for either: the Add Lead, Book Appointment and surgery forms pick them automatically and the Branch / Doctor filters are hidden. (The rule is generic — any hospital with exactly one branch or one doctor gets the same simpler screens; a hospital with several still sees the choosers.)

## What the pilot proves

One continuous journey per enquiry: **enquiry → contact → appointment → arrival → consultation → treatment outcome → follow-up / procedure**, with the original source kept all the way, and a simple performance view for the owner (funnel, drop-offs, source, team). It is **not** an EMR: no prescriptions, diagnosis, medications, reports or clinical notes are stored.

## Accounts (local / demo only)

`namokar.superadmin` (owner), `namokar.admin`, `namokar.frontdesk` (Receptionist), `namokar.coordinator` and `namokar.coordinator2` (the two Patient Coordinators), `namokar.doctor` (Dr. Poonam Jain) `@pulseos.local`. The demo password is the `DEMO_PASSWORD` of the environment it was seeded in; it is **never** shown in the product. All data is fictional.
